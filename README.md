python code for 6-01 course

This lab uses pipenv to set virtual environment.

Watch the pipfile and piplock for settings and list of dependencies.

The test uses the unittest Python library.

I also run in Python 3.10 and maybe after this will upgrade using 3.11

The SOAR also asking for upgrades but let's just stick to this version because the pypi and thus pip said the 1.5 is the latest version.
